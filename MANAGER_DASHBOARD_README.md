# Manager Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive manager dashboard for approving/rejecting employee expense requests with a comment system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Manager Dashboard (`/dashboard/manager`)
- **Statistics Overview**: 
  - Pending approvals count
  - Approved expenses (current month)
  - Rejected expenses (current month)
  - Total pending amount
  
- **Expense List**:
  - Shows all pending expense requests from team members
  - Displays expense details: amount, category, date, submitter
  - Shows previous comments/feedback if any
  - Visual status badges (Pending, In Progress, Approved, Rejected)

- **Approval Actions**:
  - **Approve Button**: Opens dialog to approve with optional comment
  - **Reject Button**: Opens dialog to reject with required comment
  - Comments are mandatory for rejections, optional for approvals
  - Real-time feedback to users

### 2. Enhanced Employee Dashboard
- **Updated Expense Display**:
  - Card-based layout matching website UI/UX
  - Shows manager feedback prominently
  - Visual indicators for approval/rejection (green/red badges)
  - Comment display with manager name and timestamp
  - Consistent design with existing dashboard components

### 3. API Endpoints Created

#### `/api/expenses/pending-approval` (GET)
- Fetches all pending expenses from employees reporting to the manager
- Filters by manager's approval status
- Includes expense details, submitter info, and previous approvals

#### `/api/expenses/manager-stats` (GET)
- Returns statistics for the manager dashboard
- Counts: pending, approved, rejected expenses
- Calculates total pending amount
- Filtered by current month for approved/rejected counts

#### `/api/expenses/approve-reject` (POST)
- Handles approval/rejection of expenses
- Required fields: expenseId, decision (APPROVE/REJECT)
- Comment required for rejections
- Creates approval decision records
- Updates expense status accordingly
- Maintains approval history for audit trail

#### `/api/expenses/recent` (GET - Updated)
- Enhanced to include approval decisions and comments
- Shows manager feedback on employee dashboard

## Database Schema Utilization

### Models Used:
- **Expense**: Main expense records
- **ExpenseApprover**: Tracks who needs to approve and their status
- **ApprovalDecision**: Stores approval/rejection decisions with comments
- **ApprovalHistory**: Audit trail of all approval actions
- **EmployeeManager**: Links employees to their managers

## UI/UX Consistency

### Design Elements:
- ✅ Consistent with existing dashboard layout
- ✅ Uses same Card components from shadcn/ui
- ✅ Matching color scheme and typography
- ✅ Responsive grid layouts
- ✅ Consistent button styles and badges
- ✅ Same icon library (lucide-react)

### Color Coding:
- **Green**: Approved status, approve actions
- **Red**: Rejected status, reject actions
- **Yellow**: Pending status
- **Blue**: In-progress status

## User Flow

### Manager Workflow:
1. Manager logs in → Redirected to `/dashboard/manager`
2. Sees statistics and list of pending approvals
3. Reviews expense details
4. Clicks "Approve" or "Reject"
5. Dialog opens showing expense summary
6. Adds comment (optional for approve, required for reject)
7. Confirms decision
8. System updates expense status and notifies employee

### Employee Workflow:
1. Employee submits expense
2. Waits for manager approval
3. Checks dashboard to see status
4. If approved/rejected, sees manager's comment
5. Understands reason for approval/rejection
6. Can take appropriate action if needed

## Security Features
- ✅ Session-based authentication required
- ✅ Role-based access control (MANAGER role required)
- ✅ Managers can only see expenses from their direct reports
- ✅ Validation of approver status before allowing decisions
- ✅ Prevents duplicate decisions

## Next Steps to Test

1. Run Prisma migration:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```

2. Set up manager-employee relationship in database:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO "EmployeeManager" (id, employeeId, managerId)
   VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), '<employee_id>', '<manager_id>');
   ```

3. Create test expense from employee account

4. Login as manager and test approval/rejection flow

5. Check employee dashboard for feedback display
